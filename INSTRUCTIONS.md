# INSTRUCTIONS

## Technologies
This project was developed using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

The stack used for this project was chosen based on personal preference and familiarity.

## Are there any improvements I could make to my submission?
The Dashboard could be improved to allow more query options such as search by mission name and rocket used, include sorting, fetch more missions (and implement some sort of pagination). The image could also be turned into a carousel, since the API returns multiple pictures most of the time.

## What would I do differently if I were allocated more time?
- Improve page layout and overall design;
- Refactor some of the components to make them more reusable;
- Use Vue instead of React, since it was the desired framework.
