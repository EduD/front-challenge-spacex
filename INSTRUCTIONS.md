## About the tecnologies used

 - **Vue.js**

I've already been using Vue.js on my actual intern job for the last 7 months, so it was an good choice for an easy to work and agile framework for such a simple application. 
Vue 3.0 CLI is also an pretty fast-setup environment, with vue-router and eslint+babel setups.

 - **Vue apollo**

This was my first time pairing Vue.js with Graphql, and, besides the challenge itself prefering the use of the Apollo client, i've found that it is the most easy to work Graphql +Vue.js implementation so far.

## What could i improve?

  A lot!
Ive done the challenge in nearly 3 hours of coding ( and half of that was understanding Apollo itself, since i've never used it ).

But mostly, definetely adding **Testing** to the application is an top-priority.
And of course, **layout-wise** im not that proud yet of the result, but since it was supposed to be an fast-built app, ive focused on that idea!

## If i have more time, what would ive done?

I would sharpen the layout and css, probably using SASS to help on the scalability of the project.
Also, the GraphQL SpaceX API is pretty impressive, with a lot of data, so theres almost infinite ways to add 
new features. Probably adding that in-depth mission details, with a lot of data using the mission ID.

Development-wise, i would focus on some **testing** and also learning **better practices of GraphQL**, since i've never used it professionally.
