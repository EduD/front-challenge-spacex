## Q.A

1. How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution 

- I used React to help build a component app. This helps you modularize your application and keep it scalable.

- I used Jest to design tests and run tests. Using tests helped me build a complete component before coding it.

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission

I believe I can improve the UX of the cards, organize the layout so that the user has a great experience. The user experience is ok, but making these changes might improve

3. What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

Improve the layout to collect more information that the API provides
