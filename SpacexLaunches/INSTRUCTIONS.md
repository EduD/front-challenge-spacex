- ## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
    I used the angular framework, which is the one out of the 3 proposed that I am more familiar with, and apollo client.

- ## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission
    Better testing and design.

- ## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time
    I would have definitely used Vue instead of angular and made a richer solution
