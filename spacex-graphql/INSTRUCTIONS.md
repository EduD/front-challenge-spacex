# How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution

_I used React as a development framework and styled components for the named componentization. To consume the graphql api I used the apollo client react. It was my first time using Grapqhql and I thought it was very good to be able to select what data the api will bring me and still be able to cache it almost automatically and having faster data delivery_

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission

_I could improve the layout. Although I thought it was cool and I agree with the content. It could also have images of the missions , but in the past api there were no images_

# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

_I could take another challenge that would further test my development skills and get me ready for the job_
