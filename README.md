## Q.A

1. How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution 

- I utilized React to build a component-based application, enabling modularization and scalability.

- I employed Jest to design and execute simple unit tests, ensuring components were fully developed before implementation.

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission

- I could enhance the UI Design of the cards by organizing the layout more effectively. While the current user experience is satisfactory, these changes could lead to significant improvements.

3. What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

- I could have explore a bit deeper into the architecture of GraphQL APIs and unitary tests.
